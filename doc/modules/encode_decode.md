# Encoding & Decoding

Full (and modern) encoding/decoding library, including base64.

## Usage

It's a header-only library. Just add the 'include' folder to your compiler's includes-search folder and that's all!

## Examples (Where to start)

* [base64_hello_world](../../src/examples/encoding/base64_hello_world.cpp): Hello world example introducing a very first (and simple) example.
* [base64_full_cycle](../../src/examples/encoding/base64_full_cycle.cpp): Full encode and decode base 64 example.
