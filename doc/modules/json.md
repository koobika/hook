# Json
Full (and modern) Json support library, including value-types, arrays, objects and str-to-json and json-to-str importer/exporters.

## Usage

It's a header-only library. Just add the 'include' folder to your compiler's includes-search folder and that's all!

## Examples (Where to start)

* [json_hello_world.cpp](../../src/examples/structured/json_hello_world.cpp): Hello world example introducing a very first (and simple) example. Try it!*</br>
* [json_basic_types.cpp](../../src/examples/structured/json_basic_types.cpp): Introducing all the basic value-types available.
* [json_arrays.cpp](../../src/examples/structured/json_arrays.cpp): Introducing array-based value.
* [json_objects.cpp](../../src/examples/structured/json_objects.cpp): Introducing object-based value.
* [json_import.cpp](../../src/examples/structured/json_import.cpp): Import json data from files.
